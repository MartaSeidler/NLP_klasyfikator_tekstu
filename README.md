## Text Classification Project

### Overview
This project involves building a text classification model to categorize polish texts into two classes: "astronomy" and "other". The model is trained using various preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in classifying new, unseen texts.

### Features
- Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, stopwords removal.
- Vectorization: Text data is transformed using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Model Training: Logistic Regression is used for training the classification model.
- Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the class of new text data.
